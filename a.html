        <h4>The Frist Native Amreican</h4>
            <p>In the early years of 1000D.A the Sunset crater erupted before the earliest Native American (I don't know the name of the tribe). These people build their house in a cave or under a cliff. Because they do not put a roof on the house. They use a top part of the cave/cliff as a roof of the building. These building are usually near a water source or  man-made watering hole. But most of the water come from the rain coming off the mountain's wall.</p>
            <p>In the 1400 AD these people move away for unknown reason. But the house are still here under the caves/cliffs until this day. </p>

        <h4>Arizona's history</h4>
            <p>Arizona was the a territory of the Spain this where they found 20 different tribes in Arizona like the Navajo, Hopi, and all of the Apaches, etc. The Mexican-American war was a war of the land that Americans wanted to claim the Mexican's land. After the Mexican lost the war the Americans relocated the Native American in reservation all around the state.</p>
            <p>But before the tell were relocated, all of the Navajos have to walk to Fort Summers and they called it the 'long walk'. the fort was locate 300 miles away at Bosque Redondo. In 1865 the Navajos agreed to put in a reservation, so the army's let some of them to sign a documents. But they did not sign this documents, instead they use a finger print as a signature. The other tribes may have been move and relocated to the reservation.</p>
